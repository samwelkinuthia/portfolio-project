            <p><b>Here's a poem by dylan thomas</b></p>
            <li>Do not go gentle into that good night,</li>
            <li>Old age should burn and rave at close of day;</li>
            <li>Rage, rage against the dying of the light.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Though wise men at their end know dark is right,</li>
            <li>Though wise men at their end know dark is right,</li>
            <li>Do not go gentle into that good night.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright</li>
            <li>Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,</li>
            <li>Rage, rage against the dying of the light.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight,</li>
            <li>And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way,</li>
            <li>Do not go gentle into that good night.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight</li>
            <li>Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay,</li>
            <li>Rage, rage against the dying of the light.</li>
            <br>
            <li>And you, my father, there on the sad height,</li>
            <li>Curse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray.</li>
            <li>Do not go gentle into that good night.</li>
            <li>Rage, rage against the dying of the light.</li>
